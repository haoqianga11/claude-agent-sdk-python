# Greet Command

This is a custom greeting command from the demo plugin.

When the user runs this command, greet them warmly and explain that this message came from a custom plugin loaded via the Python SDK. Tell them that plugins can be used to extend Claude Code with custom commands, agents, skills, and hooks.
